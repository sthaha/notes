    "### Tape\n",
    " An **infinitely** long tape like the memory: imagine `...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB...` as a blank tape\n",
    " \n",
    "### Head\n",
    "A `head` (say `^`) that points to a location/cell on the tape. Any write or read will be done at the `head` and can be moved right or left\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB...\n",
    "      ^\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruction has two parts to it \n",
    "1. reads the current value on tape and store a new value (could be the same old value) to the tape\n",
    "2. moves the `head` to `right` or `left` by **1**\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "Given the state below\n",

    "store 2\n",

    "Old: ...BBBBBBBBBBBBB...\n",

    "The problem with the solution above is that say the `head` reads `B` what should it do? Should it execute the first instruction `B -> X, R` or should it execute the last `B -> B, R`? To disambiguate, Turing introduces **state** and reads something like \"Given this `state` and the `head` reads `X` then do `Y`. The turns the above set of instructions into\n",
